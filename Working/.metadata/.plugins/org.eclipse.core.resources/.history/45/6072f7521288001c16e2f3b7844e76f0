//Inheritance (Subclass and Superclass)

/*
 * In Java, it is possible to inherit attributes and methods from one class to another. We group the "inheritance concept" into two categories:
 * subclass (child) - the class that inherits from another class
 * superclass (parent) - the class being inherited from
 * To inherit from a class, use the extends keyword.
