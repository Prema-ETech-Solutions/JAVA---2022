//Another way to achieve abstraction in Java, is with interfaces.
//An interface is a completely "abstract class" 
//that is used to group related methods with empty bodies:
public interface Interface_11 
{
	//refer interface_class1_11
	public void Show();
	public void Sum(double a,double b);
	public void Sub(int a, int b);
